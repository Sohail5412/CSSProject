        <h1>Mohammad Sohail Khan</h1>
        <p class="bio">My name is Mohammad Sohail Khan, and I hail from New Delhi, India. 
            When I was young, my family relocated to Saudi Arabia, where I completed my basic education,
             immersing myself in a rich and diverse culture. Eventually, we moved back to India, where I finished
              my high school studies. Since childhood, I was fascinated by technology, always eager to learn how things
               work and how I could make them better. This natural curiosity and passion led me to Canada to pursue a career
                in programming. Here, I'm not just learning the technical skills required to be a successful programmer;
                 I'm exploring the creative art of coding and developing solutions that have a meaningful impact.
                  Join me on this exciting journey as I continue to grow, innovate, and contribute to
                   the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
